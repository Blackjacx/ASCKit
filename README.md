This is a package providing access to Apple's App Store Connect API. The idea was born since I have to manage 30+ apps in our account in my day-to-day job. I needed a tool where I can make batch adjustments to all apps at once. This package provides the backbone of two of my apps that do that job:
- an iOS app (not public yet) and
- my command line tool `asc` which is part of my [Assist package](https://github.com/Blackjacx/Assist)

I continuously evolve ASCKit as I require new functionality here. Please feel free to provide feedback or add new functionality by opening a PR.
